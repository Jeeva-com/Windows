Batch/Powershell - Scripts/Commands

  - PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution consisting of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework. PowerShell works on     Windows, Linux, and macOS.
  - Batch files are script files for DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows. It consists of a series of commands to be executed by the command-line interpreter, stored in a  text file.     When you run a batch file, a shell program (usually COMMAND.COM or cmd.exe) reads the file and runs the commands, usually line by line.
